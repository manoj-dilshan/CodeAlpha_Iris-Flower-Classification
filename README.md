# CodeAlpha_Iris-Flower-Classification
A beginner-friendly machine learning project that classifies Iris flower species (setosa, versicolor, virginica) using measurements of sepal length/width and petal length/width. Built with Python and scikit-learn, this project walks through data preprocessing, EDA, model training, evaluation, and basic deployment.
